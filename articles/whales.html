    <h1>Whales</h1>
    <p>Whales are magnificent creatures of the sea. Learn about their diet, predators, and more as you read this article.</p>

      <h2>Diet</h2>
      <p>Whales are divided into 2 groups: baleen whales and toothed whales. Baleen whales have soft pieces of "baleen" that are like sieves to filter through krill and sea plants from the water. Toothed whales have teeth that they use to chomp down on animals like squid and fish.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Predators</h2>
      <p>Whales do not have many predators, as they are so big. But sometimes sharks in a group will attack a whale that is by itself.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Breathing</h2>
      <p>Whales have blowholes, which are holes at the top of whales' heads. When whales rise to the water's surface to breath, a stream of water comes out of their blowhole. Some whales can hold their breath for up to 90 minutes!</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Babies</h2>
      <p>Baby whales are called calves. When the calf is born, she drinks her mother's milk and plays with other calves. The mother has to push the calf up to the surface so it can breathe. Calves usually stay with their mother for a year, then they go off to find themselves a mate.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Threats</h2>
      <p>Whales are endangered because of many things. Some boats use drag net to catch fish, but whales can be caught in them. Whalers illegally harpoon whales. And yet other people litter and it pollutes the ocean, harming whales and many other sea creatures. Lots of whales are endangered, sadly.</p>
