# Frogs and Toads

You may think frogs and toads are slimy, but think again. We would not live without frogs and toads!

## Diet

Frogs and toads have a long sticky tongue that they use for catching insects. The frogs' tongue comes out so fast that the insect can't even see it! There is one exception to these insect eating amphibians. A long time ago, there was a frog called the Devil Frog. It was the size of a beach ball and it ate small animals!
