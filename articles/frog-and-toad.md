# Frogs and Toads

You may think frogs and toads are slimy, but think again. We would not live without frogs and toads!

## Diet

Frogs and toads have a long sticky tongue that they use for catching insects. The frogs' tongue comes out so fast that the insect can't even see it! There is one exception to these insect eating amphibians. A long time ago, there was a frog called the Devil Frog. It was the size of a beach ball and it ate small animals!

## Predators
Birds of prey are the main predators of frogs. But weasels, bobcats, and other mammals also dine on delicious toad legs. Sadly, a large percent of the frog population is killed by cars. But during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 50% fewer frogs died from cars since people were not driving in their cars as much.

## Range
Frogs can be found all over the world, especially in tropical areas such as South America and Southeastern Asia. Lots of toads are found in North America.
Difference between frogs and toads
Frog skin is more damp and smooth, and they have a lot of webbing between their toes. Frogs also spend much of their time under water. Toads have bumpy dry skin and only a small amount webbing between their toes. Toads spend most of their time on land.

## Threats
Unfortunately, frogs face many threats. Some people dump trash, and it pollutes their river home. Some people accidentally drive over frogs in the road. To make more houses, lumber companies chop down the frogsâ€™ forest and jungle home. That also affects many other critters.
